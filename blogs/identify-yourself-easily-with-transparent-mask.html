      <p>Do you feel like having lost the identity behind those masks in the times of this pandemic?</p>
      <p>Do you fear removing your mask in Airports, Offices & other public places for verification to security authorities.</p>

    <section id="intro">
      With the out-break of Corona Virus, India, along with many countries imposed a Lock-down. Now Lock-downs have been lifted & the 
      working and new-normal life structure is being reduced slowly and steadily with a new normal which is with social distancing rules and 
      wearing a mask all the time as soon as one steps out of the home.
      <br><br>
      In the process of doing that, we are somehow losing our identity. It has become really difficult for everyone to recognise each other 
      because of the masks, other that it being a security hazard. 
      <br><br>
      At Airports, Offices & other public places, one has to repeatedly remove their masks to ascertain their identity, this exposes one to 
      risks at the most vulnerable places. In Airports for example, one has to remove their masks at Airport Entry, Boarding Pass, Security Screening, 
      & other places where identity needs to be verified. Its a necessity from Safety & Security POV & hence can't be skipped. 
      <br><br>
      We need to resolve this & the only effective way to this is by usine transparent masks.
    </section>
    <section>
      We all have resumed back to our offices and the identity is the main part of any organisation. One has to identify the employees, 
      service-providers & customers. Imagine the horror when a key customer walks in & you donâ€™t recognise them! Again in the process of the 
      identification here it is again hazardous as it is done in public places. The best possible solution for that is a transparent mask.
    </section>
    <section>
      COVID-19 is here & in the absence of any vaccine or medication, all that we can do is prevent ourselves in a public place is, use masks & 
      social distance. One look on the streets shows that people avoid wearing masks & the ones who do are reluctant about it. It is not that 
      people are lazy & hence avoid it. The primary reason people avoid wearing masks is because it steals their identity & hides their experessions.
    </section>
    <section>
      The only way to overcome this is to not let anything take over your face. That is why UNMASK&trade; has come up with India's first transparent 
      mask to Unmask your smile, expressions & Identity.
